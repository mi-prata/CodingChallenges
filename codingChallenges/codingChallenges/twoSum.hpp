//Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
std::vector<int> twoSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int target);

//The same implementation as above but uses an ordered map as container for the input.
//For this problem search is much faster in this container than in a vector, see the following link.
