>
>Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
>
>Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>
>Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

<a name="sortCharactersByFrequency"></a>
* **451 - Sort Characters By Frequency**, from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)
>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
>
>Examples:
>
>Input:
"tree"
>
>Output:
"eert"
>
>Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
