In this repository you can find my solutions to assorted computer science problems.

## Problems & Solutions
___
* Palindromes, from _Accelerated C++_
>Palindromes are words that are spelled the same right to left as left to right. Write a program to find all the palindromes in a dictionary. Next, find the longest palindrome.


* [find_Palindromes](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/f7e99a1170b4f8a789e216e335dcb4db8d5ba0cc/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L11)

This problem can be solved with a more elegant solution than the one I initially implemented, simply by using functions from the standard library, function [is_palindrome](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/f7e99a1170b4f8a789e216e335dcb4db8d5ba0cc/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L39).

* Length of longest substring without repeating characters, from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
>
>Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
>
>Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>
>Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

___

* Max Consecutive Ones from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)
>Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Example 1:
>Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
>
> Output: 3
>
>Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
>
>Note:
>
>The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

___
* ZigZag conversion from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/)
>Receives a string and writes it in zig zag pattern across a given number of rows (input parameter).

* [convertZigZag](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/3961df6e81e431bc0113ec3856f490cab47a776e/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L92)
