In this repository you can find my solutions to assorted computer science problems.

## Problems

* Palindromes, from _Accelerated C++_
>Palindromes are words that are spelled the same right to left as left to right. Write a program to find all the palindromes in a dictionary. Next, find the longest palindrome.



* Length of longest substring without repeating characters, from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
>
>Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
>
>Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>
>Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solutions

* Palindromes - [find_Palindromes](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/f7e99a1170b4f8a789e216e335dcb4db8d5ba0cc/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L11)

This problem can be solved with a more elegant solution than the one I initially implemented, simply by using functions from the standard library, function [is_palindrome](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/f7e99a1170b4f8a789e216e335dcb4db8d5ba0cc/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L39).

* Length of longest substring without repeating characters - [longest_Substring](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/f7e99a1170b4f8a789e216e335dcb4db8d5ba0cc/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/auxiliarStringFunctions.cpp#L41)
