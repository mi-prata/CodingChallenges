## Problems & Solutions
___
* Palindromes, from _Accelerated C++_
>Palindromes are words that are spelled the same right to left as left to right. Write a program to find all the palindromes in a dictionary. Next, find the longest palindrome.


* [find_Palindromes](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/8112b8ad62b2c6490c2416a44582572d9a55aafd/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/find_palindromes.cpp#L11)

This problem can be solved with a more elegant solution than the one I initially implemented, simply by using functions from the standard library, function [is_palindrome](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/8112b8ad62b2c6490c2416a44582572d9a55aafd/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/find_palindromes.cpp#L39).

* Length of longest substring without repeating characters, from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
>
>Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
>
>Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>
>Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

___

* Max Consecutive Ones from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)
>Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Example 1:
>Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
>
> Output: 3
>
>Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
>
>Note:
>
>The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000


* [findMaxConsecutiveOnes](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/8112b8ad62b2c6490c2416a44582572d9a55aafd/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/find_max_consecutive_ones.cpp#L12)

___
* ZigZag conversion from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/)
>Receives a string and writes it in zig zag pattern across a given number of rows (input parameter).

* [convertZigZag](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/1fdf1b17b4520cd496df0213a3b1b78f21fef8e6/CodingChallenges/CodingChallenges/zig_zag_conversion.cpp#L9)

___



* 3Sum from  [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)
>Given an array **nums** of *n* integers, are there elements *a, b, c* in **nums** such that *a + b + c* = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
>
> Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

* [threeSum](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/5e2dc373a089f9ddac13f1d9d4ab6a8df1d10dfa/codingChallenges/codingChallenges/3sums.cpp#L11)

___



* Two Sum from [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)
> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

* [twoSum](https://github.com/mi-prata/CodingChallenges/blob/5cd8dbdc5791f60fe7214d74a8c372122a357e02/codingChallenges/codingChallenges/twoSum.cpp#L34)
